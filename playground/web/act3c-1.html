            <p>I</p>
            <p>think</p>
            <p>that I</p>
            <p>shall never see</p>
            <p>A poem lovely as a tree.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A tree whose hungry mouth</p>
            <p>is pressed against the earth&#39;s sweet</p>
            <p>flowing breast, a tree that looks at God</p>
            <p>all day and lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
            <br>
            <p>A tree that may in Summer wear a nest of robins</p>
            <p>in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain;</p>
            <p>Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
            <p>Poems</p>
            <p>are</p>
            <p>made</p>
            <p>by</p>
            <p>fools</p>
            <p>like</p>
            <p>me,</p>
            <p>But</p>
            <p>only</p>
            <p>God</p>
            <p>can</p>
            <p>make a tree.</p>
