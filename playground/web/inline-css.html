Instructions:

Using an inline style sheet, design a CSS document with two headers containing <h1> and <h2> in which <h1> and <h2> elements both are
green in text, 22pt, Times New Roman. Add a paragraph of text in black (any paragraph will do with 3 sentences), Times New Roman font,
but in 12 pt size. No declaration may be repeated. You can include comments to signify what each rule does.

<!DOCTYPE html>

    <head>
        <title>Inline CSS</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Apply individual `styles` to all elements. -->
        <h1 style="color: green; font-size: 22pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
        <h2 style="color: green; font-size: 22pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Description</h2>
        <!-- Should we add the `color` attribute? Most browsers set it to "black" as default anyway. -->
        <p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
