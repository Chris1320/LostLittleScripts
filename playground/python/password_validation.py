Password Validation

You're interviewing to join a security team. They want to see you build a password evaluator for your technical interview to validate the input.

Task:
Write a program that takes in a string as input and evaluates it as a valid password. The password is valid if it has at a minimum 2 numbers, 2 of the following special characters ('!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '&', '*'), and a length of at least 7 characters.
If the password passes the check, output 'Strong', else output 'Weak'.

Input Format:
A string representing the password to evaluate.

Output Format:
A string that says 'Strong' if the input meets the requirements, or 'Weak', if not.

Sample Input:
Hello@$World19

Sample Output:
Strong

import string

password = str(input("Enter your password: "))
nums, symbols = 0, 0
req_nums, req_symbols = 2, 2
if len(password) < 7:
    print("Weak")

else:
    for c in password:
        if c.isdigit():
            nums += 1
        elif c in string.punctuation:
            symbols += 1

    if nums >= req_nums and symbols >= req_symbols:
        print("Strong")

    else:
        print("Weak")
